# Introduction to Seaborn
# Seaborn is a Python library built on top of Matplotlib that makes it easier and prettier to create complex, beautiful visualizations.

# Why Seaborn?
# Matplotlib is powerful but very low-level.
# Seaborn adds high-level features like automatic styling, themes, color palettes, and dataframe integration.
# Seaborn comes with built in Datasets
# Makes complex plots (like boxplots, violin plots, heatmaps, pairplots) very easy.
# In short:

# Less code
# Better-looking graphs
# Easy handling of DataFrames (like from pandas)
# Basic Setup
# Install Seaborn if you don't have it
!pip install seaborn
 
# Import Seaborn
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Seaborn Themes
# Seaborn automatically makes your plots look good, but you can even control the overall "theme."

sns.set_theme(style="darkgrid")  # Options: whitegrid, dark, white, ticks

# Example:

import numpy as np
 
x = np.array([0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ,10, 60])
y = np.sin(x)
 
sns.lineplot(x=x, y=y)
plt.title('Beautiful Line Plot')
plt.show()

# Summary
# Seaborn makes complex, attractive, and statistical plots simple and ready for professional reports.

# Matplotlib is important to know for fine-tuning or customization, but Seaborn should be your first choice for day-to-day plotting.

# In real-world Data Science projects, Seaborn saves hours of manual work by offering higher-level, smarter defaults.

# Output of arr3D.shape is â†’ (depth, rows, columns)
print(arr3D.shape) # Output: (2    , 2   , 3) 


# Accessing elements in 3D:

# First sheet, second row, third column
print(arr3D[0, 1, 2])  # Output: 6

print(arr3D[:, 0, :])   # Get the first row from both sheets


# Practical Example: Selecting Data Along Axes

# Get all rows of the first column
first_col = arr[:, 0]
print(first_col, "\n")  # Output: [1 4 7]

# Get the first row from each "sheet" in a 3D array
first_rows = arr3D[:, 0, :]
print(first_rows)


# Changing Data Along an Axis

# Replace all elements in column 1 with 0

arr[:, 1] = 0
print(arr)

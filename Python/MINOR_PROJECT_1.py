# If itâ€™s your first project, Iâ€™d recommend PDF to Audiobook Converter or PDF Page Extractor & Splitter â€” theyâ€™re easy enough to implement but still look impressive.
#
# If you want, I can make you a CS50P-compliant project blueprint for PDF to Audiobook Converter with:
#
# project.py function layout
#
# Ideas for 3+ custom functions
#
# pytest test examples
#
# Libraries list for requirements.txt
#
# That way youâ€™ll still code it yourself but have a ready-to-follow roadmap.
#
# Do you want me to prepare that?

#
# Nice choice bro âœ… â€” PDF Page Extractor & Splitter is perfect for a first CS50P project:
#
# Beginner-friendly (only needs basic file handling + PDF library).
#
# Useful in real life (splitting big PDFs into smaller parts).
#
# Can be extended later (merge, rename, password-protect, etc.).
#
# Fits CS50P requirements (main function + 3 extra functions + tests).
#
# Project Blueprint: PDF Page Extractor & Splitter
# 1. File Structure
# project/
# â”‚â”€â”€ project.py          # main logic & functions
# â”‚â”€â”€ test_project.py     # pytest functions
# â”‚â”€â”€ requirements.txt    # list of libraries
#
# 2. requirements.txt
# PyPDF2
#
#
# (Just one library â€” easy to install & use)
#
# 3. Functions (CS50P Requirement)
# # project.py
#
# def main():
#     # Menu to take PDF file path & page ranges from user
#     pass
#
# def extract_pages(pdf_path, start_page, end_page, output_path):
#     # Extract pages from start_page to end_page
#     pass
#
# def validate_page_range(start_page, end_page, total_pages):
#     # Check if the range is valid
#     pass
#
# def get_total_pages(pdf_path):
#     # Return total number of pages in PDF
#     pass
#
# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     main()
#
# 4. Test Functions
# # test_project.py
#
# def test_validate_page_range():
#     # Valid range
#     assert validate_page_range(1, 3, 10) == True
#     # Invalid range (start > end)
#     assert validate_page_range(5, 3, 10) == False
#     # Out of bounds
#     assert validate_page_range(0, 3, 10) == False
#
# def test_get_total_pages():
#     # Check if function returns correct number for a sample PDF
#     pass
#
# def test_extract_pages():
#     # Extract & check if output file exists
#     pass
#
# 5. Flow of Program
#
# Ask user for PDF file path.
#
# Show total number of pages (using get_total_pages).
#
# Ask user for start and end page.
#
# Validate using validate_page_range.
#
# Extract pages into new PDF (using extract_pages).
#
# Confirm completion.
#
# 6. Extensions (Optional)
#
# Allow multiple ranges at once (split into several files).
#
# Support drag-and-drop in future.
#
# Add password-protected PDF support.

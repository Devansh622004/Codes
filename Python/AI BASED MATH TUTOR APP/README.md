# AI-Based Math Tutor – Complete Project Plan

## 1. Project Idea

* Build an AI-based Math Tutor as a web app.
* Focus on step-by-step problem solving, visualization, and user progress tracking.
* Main goal: modern, interactive web app without deep diving into frontend, keeping AI/ML/Data Science as the core.

## 2. Tech Stack

* Backend: Python + Flask (or FastAPI later)
* Math Engine: Sympy, NumPy, Pandas
* Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, MathJax, minimal JS (fetch API)
* Database: SQLite
* Visualization: Matplotlib (static) -> Plotly (interactive graphs)

## 3. Learning Roadmap (Phase-wise)

### Phase 0 – Python Refresh (3–4 days)

* Revise functions, OOP basics, error handling
* Mini-Project: `EquationSolver` class for linear equations

### Phase 1 – Backend Basics (Flask) (1 week)

* Install Flask, create routes (`/`, `/solve`)
* Handle JSON input/output
* Mini-Project: “Hello Math Tutor” API

### Phase 2 – Math Engine (Sympy) (1–2 weeks)

* Solve linear and quadratic equations
* Differentiation & Integration
* Step-by-step solution formatting
* Mini-Project: `solver.py` with functions `solve_linear`, `solve_quadratic`, `differentiate`, `integrate`

### Phase 3 – Frontend Basics (1 week)

* HTML form input + Bootstrap styling
* MathJax for equation rendering
* JS fetch API to communicate with backend
* Mini-Project: `index.html` interactive page

### Phase 4 – Database (SQLite) (1 week)

* Setup DB with `Users`, `Problems`, `Scores`
* CRUD operations with Flask
* Mini-Project: `db_setup.py` for tracking user progress

### Phase 5 – Visualization (1–2 weeks)

* Plot equations with Matplotlib -> display in web app
* Upgrade to interactive Plotly graphs
* Mini-Project: Plot `y=x^2+2x+1` and show in browser

### Phase 6 – Extras / Advanced (Optional)

* Quiz mode & hints
* Login/Signup system (Flask-Login)
* Speech-to-text & Handwriting recognition
* Modern React.js frontend
* Upgrade backend to FastAPI
* Mini-Projects: implement each optional feature individually

## 5. How to Use This Plan

1. Follow phases sequentially -> build confidence while learning.
2. Complete mini-projects per phase -> small wins every 1–2 days.
3. Integrate all mini-projects into full AI Math Tutor by Phase 5.
4. Optional Phase 6 -> add advanced features once core app works.
5. Keep checking off milestones -> track progress visually.

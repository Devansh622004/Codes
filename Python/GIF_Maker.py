# The code you're referring to creates an animated GIF using the Pillow (PIL) library in Python. Here's a breakdown of what this line means:

# âœ… Explanation:
# 1) images[0].save(...)
#    This saves the first image (images[0]) as the starting frame of the GIF.
#    You're saving it to a file named "costume.gif".

# 2) save_all=True
#    Tells Pillow to save all frames in the animation, not just the first one.
#
# 3) append_images=[images[1]]
#    Adds additional image(s) to the GIF. In this case, it's adding only images[1] as the second frame.
#    You could add more frames by writing [images[1], images[2], ...].
#
# 4) duration=200
#    Sets the duration each frame is shown, in milliseconds.
#    Here, 200ms per frame (i.e., 0.2 seconds).
#
# 5)loop=0
#   Sets the GIF to loop forever.
#   If you set loop=1, it will play once then stop. loop=2 means it plays twice, etc.

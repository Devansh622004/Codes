# GUI Based Image Filter Application
#### Video Demo: <URL HERE>
#### Description:
This project is a **Graphical User Interface (GUI) based Image Filter Application** built with **Python, Tkinter, and Pillow (PIL)**. The goal of this project is to allow users to easily load, preview, apply various filters, and save images through an interactive GUI.

The application provides multiple filter options such as:
- Grayscale
- Blur
- Sharpen
- Contrast
- Emboss
- Edge Detection
- Brightness Adjustment
- And more...

The project demonstrates knowledge of:
- **GUI Programming** using Tkinter
- **Image Processing** using Pillow
- **Modular Code Design** (functions, main structure, requirements file)
- **Event Handling** and interaction with widgets (buttons, file dialogs, labels)
- **Testing Functions** with sample test cases

This project also satisfies the **CS50 final project structure** by including:
- `project.py` → main program with `main()` function
- `test_project.py` → contains tests for filters
- `requirements.txt` → lists external dependencies (Pillow, pytest)
- `README.md` → documentation (this file)
